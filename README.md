# LSAC-Teambuildings
This website uses the Bootstrap library. For full functionality, the Bootstrap JS scripts need to run using the 'gulp' command. To set up gulp, go to the directory where index.html (the 'src' folder) is located and type the following commands in your CLI:

-> npm install gulp -g

-> npm init -y

-> npm install gulp browser-sync gulp-sass --save-dev

-> npm install bootstrap jquery popper.js --save

-> npm install gulp-cli -g

Instead of opening the index.html file, run the 'gulp' command.

-> gulp
